# Before I commence the project
    My thoughts on it all. I have been able to learn a lot so far, with this project I would be 
    putting everything into practice, it is gonna be wild. I have been able to get a very foundational
    knowledge about flexbox. I am going to put it all in here. I am hoping to get even better understanding 
    about flexbox and the practical use of flexbox in this project. Room for growth

# After the project
    The understanding is amazing. I've been able to most of what I learned in flexbox into practise, 
    It's been an eye-opening and insightful experience, what can I say? I loved every moment of this.
    Working through it was so worth it. I wish a lot of people can share in this happiness of mine.
