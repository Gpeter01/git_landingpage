# Before I commence the project
    My thoughts on it all. I have been able to learn a lot so far, with this project I would be 
    putting everything into practice, it is gonna be wild. I have been able to get a very foundational
    knowledge about flexbox. I am going to put it all in here. I am hoping to get even better understanding 
    about flexbox and the practical use of flexbox in this project. Room for growth
